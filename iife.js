/*
  IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
  In an IIFE, the function is invoked immediately and creates a local scope, which prevents variables inside the function from polluting the global namespace. By using an IIFE, you can encapsulate variables and functions so they donâ€™t interfere with other code on the page.
